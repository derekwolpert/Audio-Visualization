# The Untitled Audio Visualization Project

## Background & Overview

The Untitled Audio Visualization Project (TUAVP) is an audio visualizer program utilizing the Web Audio and D3 APIs to create real-time imagery corresponding to attributes of simultaneously playing sound (e.g. the volume of the sound, the frequency of the sound, etc.).  

The program contains a limited – yet varied – collection of built-in sounds.  Users can also input their own sounds through utilizing SoundCloud’s audio API, directly uploading from their own computer, or utilizing a microphone on their own device.

TUAVP aims to create a polished visual experience influenced by the graph types available in popular spreadsheet applications.  Users are able to choose between visualizers based on bar graphs, line graphs, circle graphs and more.
